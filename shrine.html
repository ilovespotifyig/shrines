            <image src="yesss_chat_its_zuko.png" alt="zuky wuky" height="150">
                <p>DO I EVEN NEED TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YALL? well if i do ur js a hater but ill explain anyways. chat he's js misunderstood he's going through it man imagine having a sister like azula and a dad like ozai like i would have anger issues too if my dad fucking banished me with my uncle to find someone who's been missing for the last 100 years tf- also he literally has the best character development and rlly he's js an awkward teenager who js wanted his dad to accept him back into the fire nation and ofc his honor. </p>
                
        <h2><u>Victor Nikiforov from Yuri on Ice</u></h2>
                <image src="nikiforov.webp" alt="victor nikiforov" height="150">
                    <p>victor is literally the best character that yuri on ice has to offer HE IS LITERALLY SO KIND AND INNOCENT AND PURE and plus he literally ratioed the other skaters for 5 years in a row and was not js the best skater in russia but the best skater in the whole world and such a legend. even tho he's so good at what he does, he doesn't let it get to his head and it doesn't make him a bad person overall in the slightest. his dog is THE MOST ADOREABLE THING EVER JDHFJJHBVUHBVRV  </p>
        <h2><u>Poland from Hetalia: Axis Powers</u></h2>
                    <image src="poland_and_horse.webp" alt="Poland with the horsey" height="150">
                        <p>okay ik ur like what why poland but srsly poland should get more screen time AND THE SCENE WITH THE HORSE WAS SO DAMN ADOREABLE VBHUGFUEGFUEGF and poland with lithuania is such a W duo and replicates history rlly well so ngl i rlly do like poland he doesn't necessarily have the most personality but honestly he's underrated as hell</p>
